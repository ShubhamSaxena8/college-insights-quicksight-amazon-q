QuickSight and Amazon Q project analyzing community college student enrollment, course, and evaluation data to understand professor effectiveness, student types, and cost drivers.

## Overview

The goal is to help a college board identify how to improve student satisfaction without increasing course costs. The solution uses QuickSight and Amazon Q to explore which professors and courses perform best and what factors influence evaluations.

## What This Project Does

- Prepares a student enrollment dataset in Amazon QuickSight, including calculated fields (e.g., Youth vs Adult Continuing Education).
- Uses Amazon Q to explore key questions such as:
  - Which professors have the highest evaluation scores?
  - Which courses are most expensive and which offer best value?
  - How student type and academic year relate to performance and satisfaction.
- Builds visuals and dashboards showing majors by year, student type mix, professor evaluations, and course costs.
- Creates scenarios and a data story to guide recommendations on improving satisfaction while keeping costs under control.

## Tools

- Amazon QuickSight  
- Amazon Q (Q&A, scenarios, data stories)

## Outcome

A set of dashboards, scenarios, and a data story that help decision-makers see which combinations of courses, professors, and student types are associated with higher satisfaction at sustainable cost levels.
